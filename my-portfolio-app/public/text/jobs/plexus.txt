As a MSE for Plexus's Buffalo Grove site, I work to improve site performance by designing and maintaining integrated software systems to solve manufacturing challenges. 
This is a somewhat unique role in that I work directly with my program's Product Engineering team. This gives me direct insight to the teams system needs and also gives me the opportunity to flex my more traditional manufacturing engineering skills when needed to support. I'm a strong all-rounder who is not shy to flex/learn to accommodate the business need.

Primarily, I focused on developing and deploying software to support a medical grade higher level assembly focused factory. With my primary project being medical, I have become familiar with medical regulatory requirements. I've both written and executed the regulatory documents needed to validate both vendor equipment and my own software to be used in clinical builds.
.
This position requires a broad range of technical and language competencies to be effective. Hard technical languages/skills I use to be successful include VBA, VBS, T-SQL, C++, PowerQuery, M, DAX, CAD, statistics (in support of 6sig and CI projects), PowerBI, general BSA skills. I think it's worth noting that I am self-taught for most of my computer languages & software. I believe there is nothing I can't learn when I focus my efforts- proven by what I've accomplished. I look forward to continuing to grow and improve at Plexus.
