I was responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of product demonstration units and associated crating. These units were used as marketing tools for the global sales team, and as such a high degree of attention to detail and polish was needed to be successful. I participated in lean improvement initiatives for the departments shop area. Specifically, I lead an inventory management overhaul targeting floor space reductions in the warehouse.
