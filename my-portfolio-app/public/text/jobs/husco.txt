In this role I primarily acted as the critical advanced manufacturing stakeholder in the procurement of assembly and test equipment for automotive and off-highway products. I worked directly with design engineers to assess and make recommendations to the manufacturability of new products. I acted as Husco's project leader for 3rd party automation equipment contractors ensuring deadlines were met and best practices were being adhered to. In this versatile and challenging role I had other responsibilities including: process development; hands on troubleshooting; training material development/presentation; cycle time reduction; continuous improvement; and tool design/improvement. I looked to build relationships with all levels of the organization and use feedback to maximize the profitability of our operations.
