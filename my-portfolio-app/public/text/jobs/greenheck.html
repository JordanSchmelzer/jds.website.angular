        I was responsible for the <strong>design, construction, and maintenance</strong> of product demonstration units
        and their custom crating.
        These units served as high-impact marketing tools for the global sales team, demanding a high degree of polish
        and attention to detail.

        I also contributed to <strong>lean improvement initiatives</strong> within the departmentâ€™s shop area.
        Notably, I led an <strong>inventory management overhaul</strong> focused on reducing warehouse floor space
        usage.
