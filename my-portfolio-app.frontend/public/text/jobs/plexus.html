        As a <strong>Manufacturing Systems Engineer</strong> for Plexus's Buffalo Grove site, I work to improve site
        performance by designing and maintaining integrated software systems that solve manufacturing challenges.
        This role is unique in that I collaborate directly with our <strong>Product Engineering team</strong>, giving me
        insight into system needs and allowing me to apply traditional manufacturing engineering skills when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a strong all-rounder who is not shy to <strong>adapt and learn</strong> to meet business needs.
        My primary focus is developing and deploying software to support a <strong>medical-grade, higher-level assembly
            factory</strong>.
        Through this work, I've gained familiarity with <strong>medical regulatory requirements</strong> and have
        authored and executed validation documents for both vendor equipment and my own software used in clinical
        builds.
    </p>
    <p>
        This position demands a broad range of technical and language competencies.
        Key skills I use include <strong>VBA, VBS, T-SQL, C++, PowerQuery, M, DAX, CAD, statistics (for Six Sigma and CI
            projects), PowerBI</strong>, and general <strong>Business Systems Analysis</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm proud to be largely <strong>self-taught</strong> in most of these languages and tools.
        I believe there's nothing I can't learn when I focus my effortsâ€”proven by what I've accomplished.
        I look forward to continuing to grow and improve at Plexus.
